  desc: I am a Ph.D candidate at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan. My research interests are multimedia networking, including wireless networks, video streaming, 360-degree videos, Virtual Reality (VR), and machine learning. In my Ph.D thesis, I focus on optimizing 360-degree video streaming over heterogeneous and dynamic networks to head-mounted display. Particularly, I study three challenging problems":" (i) viewer fixation prediction using neural networks considering both sensor and content data, (ii) QoE modeling based on the interplay among streaming parameters, video content characteristics, and viewer behavior, and (iii) streaming system design with optimal bitrate allocation and adaptation based on fixation prediction and QoE model.
